OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project : LED blinking with Ardunio
Objective : The objective of the Design a simple circuit with an Arduino to control an LED's blinking, learning basic setup and programming. Build the circuit with an LED and resistor, then write a sketch to control the blink rate. Gain fundamental understanding of Arduino coding and debugging techniques.
Key activities:
Here are the key activities for the LED blinking with Arduino project:
1. Set Up Arduino: Install the Arduino IDE and connect the Arduino board to your computer.
2. Build Circuit: Connect the LED and resistor to the Arduino on a breadboard.
3. Write and Upload Code: Write the blink program and upload it to the Arduino.
4. Test and Debug: Verify the LED blinks as expected, troubleshoot any issues.

 Technologies used
1. Arduino Board: Microcontroller board for interfacing with hardware components.
2. Arduino IDE: Software for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the Arduino.
3. Electronic Components: LED, resistor, breadboard, and jumper wires.
4.USB Cable: For connecting the Arduino to the computer.
